# Customer Churn Analysis — Power BI & Report

Analyzed **7,032 telecom customers** to understand who’s staying and who’s leaving using Power BI and a detailed Customer Churn Analysis Report.  

The goal was to identify churn patterns, high-risk customer groups, factors influencing retention, and provide actionable recommendations.
