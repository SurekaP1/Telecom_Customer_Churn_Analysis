# Customer Churn Analysis — Power BI

Analyzed **7,032 telecom customers** to understand who’s staying and who’s leaving using Power BI.  

The goal was to identify churn patterns, high-risk customer groups, and factors influencing customer retention, and to provide actionable recommendations.



## 💡 Key Analysis Areas

**Customer Base & Churn**
- Total customers: 7,032  
- Churned customers: 1,869 (26.6%)

**High-Risk Groups**
- Early-tenure customers (1–36 months)  
- Seniors, non-partners, non-dependents  
- High-paying customers  

**Service & Payment Insights**
- Fiber Optic users and Electronic Check payers have higher churn  
- Automatic payments (credit card, bank transfer) show lower churn
